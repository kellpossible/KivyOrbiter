KivyOrbiter
===========

a little orbit simulation game written in python using kivy

Key Features
- It currently uses an RK4 (Runge Kutta Fourth Order) integrator for the orbital motion.
- It works on android using the kivy app.
- Orbit Path calculation is in a seperate thread, improving framerate performance... I hope
